💡 Tagline
==========

*"From Hello World to Production in One Framework"*

✨ What Is This?
================

**Conch** is a modern, enterprise-grade C++ cross-platform framework that gets you from idea to deployed application at lightning speed. Whether you're building:

- 🎮 **Games** (Snake, interactive apps)
- 💰 **Trading Systems** (HFT engines, stock simulators)
- 💬 **Real-Time Communication** (Chat servers, meeting gateways)  
- 🌐 **Network Services** (TCP/UDP servers, WebSocket)
- 📊 **Data Processing** (Analytics, monitoring)

**Conch has you covered** with a battle-tested architecture, modern tooling, and zero boilerplate.

🎯 Why Choose Conch?
====================

❌ **Before Conch:**
   - Weeks spent on project setup
   - CMake configuration hell
   - Dependency management nightmares
   - IDE incompatibilities
   - No CI/CD templates
   
✅ **With Conch:**
   - **5-Second Setup**: Clone, ``./build.sh``, done.
   - **Any IDE**: VS2022, Xcode, CLion, VSCode — all pre-configured
   - **Modern Dependencies**: Conan 2.x handles everything automatically
   - **Production-Ready CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI templates included
   - **Docker Ready**: Multi-stage builds, docker-compose orchestration

🤖 Built for Humans & AI Agents
=================================

**Conch is designed for the future of software development: Human + AI collaboration.**

The framework's modular architecture and standardized structure make it the perfect environment for **rapid, AI-assisted development**:

🔹 **Modular by Design**
   Every component is self-contained and follows consistent patterns, making it easy for both humans and AI agents to:
   
   - Understand project structure instantly
   - Add new modules without breaking existing code
   - Integrate third-party libraries seamlessly
   - Scale from prototype to production

🔹 **AI-Agent Friendly**
   - **Crystal-Clear Structure**: Consistent naming, organization, and patterns across all modules
   - **Self-Documenting Code**: Modern C++23 features and clear interfaces
   - **Automated Everything**: Build, test, and deploy with single commands
   - **Intelligent Dependency Management**: Conan handles complexity automatically

🔹 **Rapid Prototyping → Production**
   Whether you're working solo, with a team, or collaborating with AI coding assistants:
   
   1. **Describe** what you want to build
   2. **Generate** modular components using AI or templates
   3. **Integrate** into the framework with minimal boilerplate
   4. **Deploy** with production-ready CI/CD pipelines

🔹 **From Idea to World-Class Product**
   - **Day 1**: Prototype your idea with AI-generated components
   - **Week 1**: Refine and test with automated quality checks
   - **Month 1**: Deploy to production with enterprise-grade infrastructure
   - **Beyond**: Scale effortlessly with battle-tested architecture

💡 **Example AI Collaboration Workflow:**

.. code-block:: text

   Human: "I need a WebSocket server for real-time notifications"
   AI Agent: Creates src/servers/notification_server/
             ├── main.cpp (WebSocket server logic)
             ├── CMakeLists.txt (Auto-integrated)
             └── tests/ (Unit tests included)
   
   Result: Production-ready server in minutes, not days.

**The future of development is collaborative, modular, and lightning-fast. Conch makes it happen.**

🛠️ Build Your Own App
=======================

**Add a new application in 3 steps:**

1. Create directory: ``src/apps/my_app/``
2. Add ``CMakeLists.txt`` (5 lines)
3. Run ``./build.sh``

**Example CMakeLists.txt:**

.. code-block:: cmake

   add_executable(my_app main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(my_app 
       PRIVATE foundation spdlog::spdlog)

Done. Your app is integrated into the framework.
